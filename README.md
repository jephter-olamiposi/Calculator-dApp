This is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. The Calculator DApp allows users to interact with a blockchain-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Features
- Create a Calculator Account: Users can create a calculator account with a custom greeting message.
- Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on-chain.
- Solana Blockchain: Leverages the speed and security of the Solana network for fast and reliable calculations.
- Anchor Framework: Uses Anchor for smart contract development, making it easier to build and test Solana programs.

# Prerequisites
- Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

# Software Requirements:
- Rust: Required for building the Solana program.
- Solana CLI: A command-line tool for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- Anchor CLI: Framework for building Solana programs efficiently.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend logic.
- Yarn: Dependency manager for JavaScript projects.

# Usage
- Creating a Calculator: Users can create a new calculator account with a custom greeting message.
- Performing Operations: Users can interact with the calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations. The results are stored and managed on the Solana blockchain.
